title: "Registering a Job Kill Order"
---

## Problem

You want to kill a process associated with a content item.

## Solution

Use the API to delete a job using its *job key*. You'll need the GUID for the content item, and the job key associated with the job you wish to kill.

- Get content GUID from the Dashboard's Info tab, or by following [Viewing Content Information](../../content/viewing-content-information/).
- To find the job key, see [Viewing Jobs for Content](../viewing-jobs-for-content/index.qmd).

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## Python

```{.python}
from posit import connect

CONTENT_ITEM_GUID = '154bd2af-e8fa-4aa4-aab8-dcef701f4af9'
JOB_KEY = 'CwCoI9tizMRRcvLw'

client = connect.Client()
client.delete(f"v1/content/{CONTENT_ITEM_GUID}/jobs/{JOB_KEY}")
```

## R

```{.r}
library(connectapi)
library(httr)

CONTENT_ITEM_GUID <- "154bd2af-e8fa-4aa4-aab8-dcef701f4af9"
JOB_KEY <- "CwCoI9tizMRRcvLw"

client <- connect()
response <- client$DELETE(
    glue::glue("v1/content/{CONTENT_ITEM_GUID}/jobs/{JOB_KEY}"),
)
```

```{.r}
> print(response)
