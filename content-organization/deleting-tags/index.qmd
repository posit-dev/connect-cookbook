## Problem

::: {.callout-warning}

You must have administrator privileges to delete a tag.

## Solution


::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## Python

You will need the identifier of the tag you wish to delete. See [Viewing Tag Information](../viewing-tag-information/index.qmd) for details.

```{.python}
TAG_ID = "your-tag-id"

client.delete(f"/v1/tags/{TAG_ID}")
```

## R

Create a `Tag` object representing the tag you wish to delete, and pass that to `delete_tag()`.

```{.r}
library(connectapi)
client <- connect()

tags <- get_tags(client)
target_tag <- tags$Departments

delete_tag(client, depts_tag)
```

The `delete_tag()` function returns a copy of the `client` object.
