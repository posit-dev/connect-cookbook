title: Transfer ownership of content
execute:
  eval: false
---

## Description

When a Posit Connect user has been deactivated, you might want to assign all of the content they owned to a different user.
This recipe identifies all content owned by one user and changes the owner to someone else.

## Output

There is no generated output from this recipe.
The purpose is to modify the state of the Connect server.

## Workflow

This recipe requires the following inputs:

1. GUID of the user you want to transfer from
2. GUID of the user you want to transfer to

This recipe then does the following:

1. Finds all content owned by the first user
2. Updates each content item to have the new owner

## Recipe

:::{.panel-tabset group="language"}

## Python

```{.python}
from posit import connect

client = connect.Client()

### User-defined inputs ###
# 1. Specify the GUID of the user whose content we are reassigning
old_owner_guid = "USER-GUID-HERE"
# 2. Specify the GUID of the user who is going to be the new owner
new_owner_guid = "OTHER-GUID-HERE"
###########################

content_to_transfer = client.content.find(owner_guid = old_owner_guid)
for item in content_to_transfer:
    item.update(owner_guid = new_owner_guid)

# There should no longer be any content owned by the old owner
len(client.content.find(owner_guid = old_owner_guid)) == 0
```

### Example output

```
>>> len(client.content.find(owner_guid = old_owner_guid)) == 0
True
```

## R

```{.r}
library(connectapi)

client <- connect()

### User-defined inputs ###
# 1. Specify the GUID of the user whose content we are reassigning
old_owner_guid <- "USER-GUID-HERE"
# 2. Specify the GUID of the user who is going to be the new owner
new_owner_guid <- "OTHER-GUID-HERE"
###########################

content_to_transfer <- client |>
  get_content(owner_guid = old_owner_guid)

for (guid in content_to_transfer$guid) {
  client |>
    content_item(guid) |>
    content_update_owner(new_owner_guid)
}

# Confirm none are owned by the old owner anymore:

client |>
  get_content(owner_guid = old_owner_guid) |>
  nrow()
```

### Example output

```
client |>
  get_content(owner_guid = old_owner_guid) |>
  nrow()

[1] 0
```
