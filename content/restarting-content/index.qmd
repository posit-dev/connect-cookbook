title: Restarting Content
---

## Problem

You need to restart interactive content. For example, your content loads a dataset into memory on startup and you want to refresh the dataset.

## Solution

Obtain the content and restart it.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## Python

Invoke the `restart` method to trigger a content restart.

```python
from posit import connect

CONTENT_GUID = "154bd2af-e8fa-4aa4-aab8-dcef701f4af9"

client = connect.Client()
content = client.content.get(CONTENT_GUID)
content.restart()
```

Invoking `restart` on content that is not interactive will result in an error. To avoid this, check the `is_interactive` attribute. This is useful if you need to restart multiple content items.

```python
if content.is_interactive:
    content.restart()
```

## R

Invoke the `content_restart` function to trigger a content restart.

```r
library(connectapi)

CONTENT_GUID <- "65d02ea5-2e26-436a-afe3-4ef98a8ba8fc"

client <- connect()
content <- content_item(client, CONTENT_GUID)
content_restart(content)
```

Invoking `content_restart()` on content that is not interactive will result in an error. To avoid this, check `content_is_interactive()`. This is useful if you need to restart multiple content items.

```r
if content_is_interactive(content) {
  content_restart(content)
}
```

## Discussion

Restarting interactive content is an asynchronous process and has potential side effects dependent on your content's architecture.

For content that utilizes a client-server architecture, anyone viewing the information must refresh their client to establish a new connection with the server. Some frameworks provide built-in support for this scenario (e.g., Shiny), but this is only sometimes the case. Please consult your framework documentation to understand the ramifications of restarting the content server.

For content that utilizes a client-only architecture, anyone viewing the content is unaffected. However, the viewer must refresh their client to see the restart side effects (e.g., an updated dataset).
