This recipe uses Airflow 2.9.2.

## Problem

You want to implement an Airflow DAG that restart content on Connect.

## Solution

Let's define an Airflow DAG that restarts the content on a schedule.

In this example, let's get credential information stored as Airflow variables.

```python
from airflow.models import Variable

CONNECT_SERVER = Variable.get("CONNECT_SERVER")
CONNECT_API_KEY = Variable.get("CONNECT_API_KEY")
```

Then create a DAG that gets the content by it's unique identifier (guid) and then restarts it.



### Full example

```python
{{< include ./airflow/dags/simple.py >}}
```
